Ashley Ringer McDonald is an associate professor of chemistry at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. She received her bachelor's degree from Mississippi College and her Ph.D. from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Her research focuses on using multiscale modeling to study molecular interactions in complex chemical contexts. She is an Associate of the [Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI)](https://molssi.org) and a member of the [MERCURY Consortium](http://mercuryconsortium.org/). She also leads [Psi4Education](https://psicode.org/posts/psi4education/), the education and outreach program of the quantum chemistry software package Psi4, and serves as the [undergraduate programming chair](https://www.acscomp.org/current-officers) for the [Computers in Chemistry (COMP) Division](https://www.acscomp.org/) of the American Chemical Society.

### Research Interests

Research in our group focuses on computational characterizations of molecular interactions in complex chemical contexts.  We also have a general interest in teaching computer programming in discipline-specific contexts and increasing students' computational compentence.  See our [Publications page](https://armcdona.github.io/pubs/) to check our recent publications.
