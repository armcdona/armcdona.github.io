**Ashley Ringer McDonald** is an associate professor of chemistry at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. She received her bachelor's degree from Mississippi College and her Ph.D. from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Her research focuses on using multiscale modeling to study molecular interactions in complex chemical contexts. She is an Associate of the [Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI)](https://molssi.org) and a member of the [MERCURY Consortium](http://mercuryconsortium.org/). She also leads [Psi4Education](https://psicode.org/posts/psi4education/), the education and outreach program of the quantum chemistry software package Psi4.  

In addition to her interests in chemistry and computing, Dr. McDonald is an avid baker and home chef.  You can learn more about her cooking by [follwing her on Instagram @quantumgirlcooks](https://www.instagram.com/quantumgirlcooks/).

**Alia Lescoulie** is a second year biochemistry major, currently working on a molecular dynamics project using the MDAnalysis library of python. She has also worked with Dr. Sapper on a project using QSAR modeling and the keras library to predict monomer pair reactivity with quantum chemical properties.

**Max Buskirk** is a second year Chemistry and Physics major, working on finding the transition state of a strained unimolecular organic reaction.  His long-term goal is to do research in physical chemistry, materials science, or some subfield of physics.
